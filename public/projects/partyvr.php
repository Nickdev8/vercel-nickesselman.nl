            <h2 class="headline">The Game I Made</h2>
            <p>
                I created a game called <a
                    href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/partyvr/9355384034552901/?require_login=true"
                    target="_blank">PartyVR</a>.<br>
                Imagine a wild party, but in virtual reality—dodge flying cakes, dance with your friends, and
                compete in
                wacky
                mini-games, all in the same virtual room!<br>
                Building it was a blast. I used Unity and the Meta XR SDK, and spent way too many late nights
                laughing
                at my own
                bugs.<br>
            </p>

    <h2 class="lead">My Struggle</h2>
    <p>
        The hardest part? Networking!<br>
        Getting everyone’s avatars to move smoothly together was like herding virtual cats.<br>
        Objects would randomly fly across the room, get stuck in walls, or—most of the time—not move at all for
        other
        players because everything kept desyncing.<br>
        Sometimes, you’d throw a cake and only you would see it fly, while everyone else just saw it floating in
        midair!<br>
        But after a lot of trial and error (and some questionable dance moves in my living room), I finally got
        it
        working... at least most of the time.<br>
    </p>

            Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to fully complete the game to my linkings.<br>
            There were still a few bugs left, and some features I wanted to add just didn’t make it in time.<br>
            But even with all the chaos, it was an amazing learning experience—and I’m excited to keep working
            on
            PartyVR in the future!<br>
